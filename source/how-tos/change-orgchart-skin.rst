Skins adapted for mobile devices

We also introduced two touch adapted skins MetroTouch and BlackMetroTouch. The main difference between these two and other skins is the large expandcollapse buttons, and you still can navigate with dragging. It is not a problem to touch them from a mobile device now. You can create a page for mobile devices, place Org Chart web part there and specify MetroTouch or BlackMetroTouch skin.
