How to print Org Chart for SharePoint and Microsoft Teams
=========================================================

When it’s is necessary to use the charts in presentations or to print the charts on paper, 
you can export (print) a current view of Org Chart to a PDF or PNG file.

Open a page where you placed an Org Chart web part. In the up-right corner, 
there is a **settings** wheel icon—click it and choose a **Print** option.

Besides standard **paper formats**, you can select an “Auto” option that will fit the page size to the current Org Chart view.

Org Chart export to a **PNG** file has no available options. The chart will be saved as a PNG image with a transparent background.
