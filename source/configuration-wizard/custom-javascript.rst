Custom JavaScript
=================

This step allows to specify custom JavaScript code. You can use functions from JavaScript framework to subscribe for box, tooltip, search results rendering events. Each event receives rendered element and object with field values from the data source. The object contains all fields specified in the templates of box, tooltip and search result.

You can use jQuery to customize rendered element. Read `description of JavaScript framework <../javascript-framework/introduction.html>`_ for more information.

On the picture below you can see example of JavaScript which changes the background of boxes to red for all employees from the **Marketing** Department.
